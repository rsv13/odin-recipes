    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

    <h2>The Secret Behind This Classic Recipe</h2>
    <p>From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other recipes.<br>
    There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found necessary, such as adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.

    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><b>Start by making the sauce</b> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</b> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesanâ€”like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p></li>
        <li><p><b>From there, it's just an assembly job.</b> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</b></p></li>
    </ol>
