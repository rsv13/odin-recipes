    <h2>What Is Butter Chicken?</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken is prepared with marinated chicken that's first grilled and then served in a rich gravy (a.k.a. curry) made with tomato, butter, and a special spice blend as a base.<br>
    Unlike most Indian curries where the preparation of the base starts with a blend of onion and a ginger garlic paste cooked in oil, butter chicken uses tomato as a base and is cooked in butter, giving it a slightly sweet flavor. Cashews and almonds add to the sweetness and richness of the dish.</p>
    
    <h2>How To Make Butter Chicken</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p><b>Marinate the chicken:</b><br>Bring the chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients together in a large bowl. Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.<br>
        Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight. </p></li>
        <li><p><b>Soak cashews and almonds:</b><br>Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Cook the chicken:</b><br>Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.<br>
        Working in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.<br>
        Once cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Start making the sauce:</b>Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.<br>
        Stir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.<br>
        Add coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Purée the sauce with the nuts:</b><br>Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked, drained cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Finish the dish:</b><br>Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.<br>
        As the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Rest the butter chicken:</b><br>Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Serve:</b><br>Serve the butter chicken with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for up to 5 days.<br>
        You can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.</p></li>
